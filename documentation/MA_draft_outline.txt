1. what it is and how it came to that?
1.1 development history of the idea
- absence of cultural interest, see for ways of education 
- the concept of analysis city 
- filling mind maps with life 
1.2 development history of the "Power of Data" project complex 
- the magic of storytelling 
- the magic of fiction 
- making the travel experience a learning experience 
- voyages through the analysis cities 
- the power of interaction 
- the outcome of gamification
1.3 linking of different subjects
- having different perspectives upon the same thing
1.4 conclusion of the advantages of the idea

2. "Power of Data" - the game
2.1 Karlstadt - city of Gentz
- showing up in a concrete example the abstract ideas 
discussed above
- describing the current state of "Gentz digital"
- showing up the differences with the data storage in "Gentz 
digital" vs. the Karlstadt ticket machine
- describing and reflecting upon the procedure of data processing
- just as the ways of introducing to different types of player 
(people with vs. without preliminary knowledge)
2.2 the analysis city network - bringing together all disciplines 
and linking them upon a common layer
- counter example Kvirasim: different topics
- showing ways to evoke interest / linking two seemingly unrelated
topics (cf. point 1.3)

3. the technologies and models used in the game
3.1 enriching unstructured data with metadata 
* the passage from storage to archival *
- searchability
- interoperability by the usage of standardised models (FRBR/LRM)
- discussion: is the flexibility of XML really an advantage?
3.2 TEI - the Text Encoding Initiative and its guidelines
- XML technologies
- advantages of the proposed tags
3.3 web technologies 
* available everywhere, no local installation needed *
- HTML/JavaScript frontend
- PHP backend with XML data
- XML for the basic gameplay data with links to additional 
material (imagery and sounds)
- XML for the underlying data (in the following example: encoded 
letters following the TEI P5 guidelines)

4. Summary and perspective
- Karlstadt: interactive board to introduce people into the 
topic of Gentz and digital edition/library
- going beyond introduction: hints to discussion are being given 
in the suburbs / outer regions
- different art registers: serving all senses, making learning 
an allround experience
- structure in the data being kept ready: interoperability, long 
term preservation possibility by common metadata layer
- Studio d'Essai: emerging from project complex, using all 
different data sources to bring universitary topics into 
broader discussion
- not to forget: possible other funding references than common 
sources by bringing several profession platforms together
